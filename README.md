## 🚀 About Me

```html
<!-- About Me Section -->
I'm currently an instructor at The Code Garden Tech Institute, where I'm teaching and mentoring bright young minds on the foundations of HTML, CSS, Git, and JavaScript.

💡 I’m driven by a passion for building digital solutions that are:

    ✨ Responsive – adaptable across devices

    👥 User-Centered – intuitive and accessible

    🌍 Impact-Oriented – solving real-world challenges

🎯 My goal is to become proficient in front-end development, with a long-term vision of contributing to tech for governance—particularly a blockchain-based portal for transparent public expenditure tracking.
